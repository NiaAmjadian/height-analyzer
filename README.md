# height-analyzer
The skyline function is a simple Python utility designed to find the tallest building from a list of given heights. It accepts any number of integer arguments representing the heights of different buildings and returns the highest value among them. This function is useful in scenarios where you need to evaluate or compare multiple values to determine the maximum — for example, in urban planning simulations, data analysis, or basic algorithmic exercises.

One important feature of this function is its flexibility: it uses Python’s *args syntax, which allows users to input any number of arguments without needing to pass a list explicitly. The function also includes a safeguard for empty input — if no heights are provided, it gracefully returns 0 instead of throwing an error. This makes it robust and beginner-friendly.

Overall, skyline is a lightweight and intuitive function that demonstrates core programming concepts such as variable-length arguments, conditional logic, and built-in functions like max() in Python.
